# 👋 Hey besties!

> welcome to my github lair 🕸️ where the bugs fear me and the smart contracts behave (mostly).

### 🚀 What I Do  
- 👩‍💻 **Smart Contracts**: Writing code on **Ethereum**, **Polygon**, and **IPFS/Filecoin**—making sure computers keep their promises.  
- 🖌️ **Graphic Design**: Creating posters for **jewelry shops** that shine as bright as the jewels.  
- 🧠 **DSA Problem Solver**: Tackling coding puzzles with no cheat codes.  
- 🌱 **Lifelong Learner**: Always upgrading my skills.  

### 🌟 Fun Facts  
- 🎯 **Hackathon Veteran**: Turning coffee and deadlines into polished projects.  
- 🏆 **Competitive Coder**: Lady Ada Coding Contest finalist (sounds fancy, right?).  
- ✨ **Creative Multitasker**: Juggling tech and design like a pro.

### 💻 what i'm up to rn:

- 🪐 **Metanest** — a cross-chain crypto wallet so intuitive even your dad might use it instead of calling you for help
- 🔬 medical image classification research — training machines to read scans better than i read my own emotions
- 📚 prepping for cmat — balancing bits, bytes & brain cells 🧠⚔️

### dev energy:
- if (web3.isTooComplicated) { makeItSimple(); }
- ui/ux should feel like gpay, not a phd thesis
- deploy → cry → debug → deploy again 🔁


### 🛠️ My Toolbox  
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity | Ethereum | Polygon | IPFS/Filecoin  
- **Database**: SQL  
- **Design Tools**: Photoshop | Canva | Figma
