# 👋 Hello World!

I’m a **smart contracts developer** by day, **poster designer** by night, and a full-time learner because let’s face it, tech never takes a break.  

### 🚀 What I Do  
- 👩‍💻 **Smart Contracts Developer**: I write code that runs on **Ethereum**, **Polygon**, and **IPFS/Filecoin**—basically, I make sure computers keep their promises without needing reminders.  
- 🖌️ **Graphic Designer**: Designing posters for **jewelry shops** that’ll make you want to buy something shiny.  
- 🧠 **DSA Problem Solver**: Solving coding puzzles like it’s a game, except there are no cheat codes.  
- 🌱 **Lifelong Learner**: Because in tech, the more you know, the less you have to say "Google it."  

### 🌟 Fun Facts About Me  
- 🎯 **Hackathon Veteran**: I turn tight deadlines, coffee, and a bit of stress into polished projects.  
- 🏆 **Competitive Coder**: Finalist at the **Lady Ada Coding Contest**—because coding challenges are my version of a good workout—without the sweat.  
- ✨ **Creative Multitasker**: Balancing tech and design without breaking a sweat (or at least trying not to).  

### 🛠️ My Toolbox  
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity | Ethereum | Polygon | IPFS/Filecoin (Building the future, one contract at a time).  
- **Database**: SQL (I know how to organize things without making a mess).  
- **Design Tools**: Adobe Photoshop | Canva | Figma (Designing like it's a second language).
